# HackThisFall
In the HackThisFall_Final.ino we haven't interfaced the MAX30100 sensor from esp32 to raspberrypi via mqtt because of timing issue.
HackThisFall_Final.ino is the final file which interfaces the gps, temperature sensor with ESP32 and then send data to the raspberrypi through mqtt.
oximeter_I2CLCD.ino is the file which only integerates MAX30100 with LCD and Arduino Uno thorugh I2C.
And all other final files are just part or testing of some sensor and part of other programmes.
Thank You
